Future forecasting is a tool that the designer should use in their practice, to envision beyond the current framework of products, services and systems.

This is my Service Design MA thesis.

I'm specifically interested in the ethical implications of future forecasting. Who gives the designer the moral high ground to decide other people's lives?

Furthermore, it is clear that an essential code of ethics doesn't exist.

As a possible solution, I propose a non-essential, open-textured ethical framework, structured as an open manifesto. Find the PDF after the break.
