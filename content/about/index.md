## About Me
I’m an experienced strategist, researcher and designer with a unique blend of quantitative skills, creativity, and coding capabilities.
My background spanning academia, think tanks and corporate roles equipped me with expertise in design methods, cutting-edge technologies such as AI, Web3, and XR, as well as business development, including future market sizing, org design and internal capability building.
